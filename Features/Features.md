# Key Features
This excerpt should highlight some of the key features of the S6Patcher. Find a full feature list below.

---
## All Versions: Higher Zoom Level
- The default zoom limit value of the game is `7200`. When patching, the angle of the RTS camera is maintained and other camera behaviours (Cutscene, ThroneRoom, FreeView) are not impacted. The pictures below show a comparison of default `7200` and `14000` zoom levels. It is recommended to not go higher than `20000`.

## All Versions: Windowed Checkbox
- A new checkbox in the options menu allows to start the game either in windowed or in fullscreen mode, depending on the state.

## All Versions: Base Game Knights in the Expansion Pack
- All seven knights can be selected in the "Eastern Realm" expansion pack. 
**Caution:** Some audio feedback lines regarding the "Eastern Realm" features (Tradepost, Well, Geologist) are missing and the stories of some maps might not really make sense (e.g. "Kestrals Wedding" when playing as Kestral).

## All Versions: Special Knights (Crimson Sabatt & Red Prince)
- The antagonistic knights "Crimson Sabatt" and the "Red Prince" can be selected in singleplayer maps in the base game and additionally in the "Eastern Realm" expansion pack.
**Caution:** The stories of some maps might not really make sense when playing as these knights.

## All Versions: Single Stop, Downgrade & Military Release
- These new buttons (originally introduced in the NEP by Netsurfer in 2009) were rewritten and are now available in campaign and singleplayer.

## All Versions: Day/Night Cycle
- A day/night cycle similar to the one in Settlers 7. This is entirely cosmetic and has no impact on the gameplay. 
<img src="https://github.com/Eisenmonoxid/S6Patcher/blob/53acfce6ab42f9d2ee6f38f1699d6a8742013e4c/Features/Night_Cycle_Final.png" width="60%" height="60%" alt="Night"/>

## Original Release: Texture Resolution
- The S6Patcher can restore the texture slider for entities and set a custom texture resolution for ground textures. The pictures show a comparison between unpatched and highest texture resolution. It is recommended to stay in the interval of 128 - 4096 for ground texture resolution.

## Original Release: Higher Resolutions
- Two new resolutions are added in the ingame video options menu: 2K (2560x1440) and 4K (3840x2160).

## Mapeditor: Unlimited Scaling
- Entities in the Mapeditor can now be freely scaled in their size.

## Mapeditor: All Entities & Textures available and freely placeable
- In the "Place Entities" dialog within the map editor, all possible entities are available. They can be freely placed and selected. **Caution:** Some entities may cause a crash, so it's recommended to save the map before placing an unknown entity. Same goes for ground textures.

## Mapeditor: Usable black border area
- The black border area of the map can now be utilized and will no longer be deleted when saving the map. If the map area needs to be restricted, the "Map Boundary" menu option can still be used manually.

- "Entertainercrash": Caused the game to crash when an entertainer was selected and send back.
- Middle Europe NPC barracks will now correctly spawn soldiers as intended.
- Salt and Dye slots are added to city storehouses so they can be traded.
- The big cathedral displays the correct name `Cathedral` instead of `B_Cathedral_Big` when selected.

- Added an Easy Debug mode, which halts the main thread on boot up and allows to attach a debugger easily.

  - Mission 3: The harbour now has the correct name.
  - Mission 11: The victory message by the Red Prince now has the correct portrait and voice message.
  - Mission 15: The reinforcements are now correctly spawned.

### Original Release

### History Edition
- The autosave can be disabled or set to a custom timer interval.

  - `D_X_Kogge`
  - `D_X_Dragonboat01`
  - `D_X_Dragonboat02`
  - `D_X_VikingBoat`   

- This will also fix the problem with `D_X_VikingBoat` not being rendered correctly in the game.

# Recommendation: DXVK
Download the latest DXVK release from the [GitHub](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/latest) repository and unpack the **d3d9.dll** and **dxgi.dll** files into the game directory, where the "Settlers6.exe" or "Settlers6R.exe" can be found. 
This wrapper will translate the Direct3D 9.0c commands to Vulkan, which is a much more modern graphics API. In the [configuration file](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/dxvk.conf), i recommend to use the following flags:
```
d3d9.presentInterval = 1
d3d9.samplerAnisotropy = 16
```
The first option enables vertical synchronisation (without it, the game runs at an unlimited framerate), the second one sets the anisotropic filtering level.
